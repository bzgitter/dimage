# Digital Image Representation

Digital image can be represented

</ul>
    <li>
     mathematically as function of 2D spacial coordinates $f(x,y)$ where the value $f$ at each point $(x,y)$ is a light intensity 
    </li>

    <li>digitally as a sample collection of picture elements called Pixels</li>
</ul>

Generally, digital image is a collection of pixels in a spacial plane where each pixel is located at $(x,y)$ & has a light intensity value given by $f(x,y)$. The figure below depicts such form of digital image representation.
